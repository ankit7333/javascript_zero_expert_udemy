    <h1>Assignment - Dot Notation and Bracket Notation</h1>
    <p>1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the

      and a capital called Helsinki.'</p>
    <p>2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then 
      decrease it by two million using brackets notation.</p>
