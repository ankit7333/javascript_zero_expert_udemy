    <h1>Coding Challenge #3</h1>
    <div>
      <p class="question">There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
        other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!</p>
        <h4>Your Tasks :-</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below</li>

          <li>2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
            and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
            as well (draw means they have the same average score)</li>

          <li>3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
            team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
            score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
            score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ÔøΩ</li>

          <li>4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
            both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
            points. Otherwise, no team wins the troph</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Test data:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110</li>
          <li>Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123</li>
          <li>Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106</li>
        </ul>
