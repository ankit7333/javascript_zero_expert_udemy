      <p class="question">
        Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners 
        about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For 
        now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
        A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Tasks :-</h4>
      <p>Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages 
        ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have 
          cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat 
          ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function 
          parameters)
        </li>
        <li>2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data</li>
        <li>3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 
          is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy ï¿½ ")</li>
        <li>4. Run the function for both test datasets.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Test data for Bonus:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]</li>
        <li>Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]</li>
      </ul>
